# escape
A text-based adventure game built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

You wake up in a dark room, unsure of how you got there. You must escape!

# how to play
Every step in the game is called a 'fork', and at each fork you'll have a choice to make. You can be bold, you can be sneaky -- but you MUST survive!
